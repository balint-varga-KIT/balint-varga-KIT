This course aims at engineering students that focus on control engineering curriculum. It encompasses
practical topics of the control engineering aspects, which can help them to be.
Two major parts are covered:

Practical examples from the control engineering problems and modelling tool using theoretical concepts from the IRS lectures (RLM, ODS). These will include

- Human-machine interaction systems (robotic applications with impedance control)
- Autonomous cooperative vehicles

Sufficient Software Tools for control engineering. These covers the fundamentals of

- Clean Code
- Version Control System (git)
- Robot Operation System (ROS)

Practical Homework Assignment to apply the lecture contents.
